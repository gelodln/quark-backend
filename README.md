# Quark: An AR Elementary Physics App – Backend

This backend system supports Quark, an Augmented Reality (AR) elementary physics learning application developed for academic research purposes. The infrastructure is built using Supabase, leveraging its PostgreSQL database, authentication services, storage, and Edge Functions for server-side logic.

The backend manages secure user authentication, AR session tracking, physics interaction data storage, assessment processing, and learning analytics. Supabase Edge Functions are used to validate client requests, enforce role-based access control, compute mastery metrics, and handle structured data processing before database insertion.
